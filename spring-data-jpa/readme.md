SPRING - DATA - JPA 

In this project I connected spring with JPA using POSTGRESQL Database and implemented
post, put and delete method.

example:-
[{"name":"Aditya","dob":"1999-06-20","email":"aditya1999@gmail.com","age":22},
{"name":"Raj","dob":"1998-09-22","email":"raj1998@gmail.com","age":23}]
